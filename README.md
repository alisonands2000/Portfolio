# Portfolio
This repository contains a series of short projects that I have done in data science and analysis. I am proficient in Python, SQL and Excel and have a strong background in analytical and stastical techniques. This portfolio showcases the projects that I have created and worked on throughout my studies in physics, astronomy, and data analytics, as well as financial applications in the stock market through my internships.
